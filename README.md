# Starkillers-HoloNet-Terminal
This is the full release of my project with a working GUI.

This is the full release of my Holobank project (12/29/25) ive been doing for the past week (started the week of December 22nd), it has implementation of a GUI, persistent storage, a dictionary you can edit (read/delete/update), i added an icon to it as well since i learned a little of how to do that (its Darth Starkiller who is my favorite variant and exclusive cosmetic of Starkiller), i might add on to this later im not sure yet since i have a new project right after this (as of 12/29/25) i plan to start by the end of this week, it has to do with Solidity which i have no clue about as of yet but its apparently derived from C++ and Java so it shouldnt be too difficult to learn.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The save button is at the very bottom of the window, so you have to either full screen or just drag it down a bit till you find the "big red button" and click save and exit, also use caps on the names of everything.

Instructions: After downloading the zip file you double click the terminal to open the program, after that you enter the Era (Clone Wars, Galactic Empire, etc), then the faction (Empire, Sith, Jedi, etc), then the name (for any vehicles or cruisers it applies as well), and then their bio (i copy pasted from wookieepedia because it was easiest), then click "upload to holobank" and you can click each tab for the "filter by era" section to find who you added (cant add eras other than whats on there)

Updates: Im not too happy with how its working, so this will be updated when i havve time to do so, the cruisers save as characters, my update/delete is missing, search doesnt work, i have lots of issues with this personally so I will fix them once I can.
